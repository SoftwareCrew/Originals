The primary objective of our application is to establish a Tourism Help Center aimed at assisting individuals in planning and organizing their trips seamlessly.

To initiate the project in React, execute the following command: `npx create-react-app Originals`.

Our application consists of six distinct components, each developed by a separate team member:

1. **Login Component**
2. **Registration Component**
3. **Component 3**
4. **Component 4**
5. **Component 5**
6. **Component 6**

Each component serves a specific function within our Tourism Help Center, contributing to the overall goal of simplifying and enhancing the travel experience for users.
